      <p class="text-center my-4">
        Biculturalism refers to the presence of two different cultures in the
        same country or region. New Zealand is a country with two peoples: the
        existing Maori and the non-Maori who migrated. As a result, Maori
        culture and non-Maori culture existed together and in the early days of
        the migration of the non-Maori people, each culture was balanced within
        each culture . In 1840, New Zealand had only about 2,000 non-Maori
        people, while the Maori people were between 70,000 and 90,000, which was
        quite large. For this reason, the culture of the non-Maori people who
        migrated could not invade the existing Maori people's culture. For a
        long time since then, the Maori and non-Maori have respected each
        other's culture and even learned each other's culture. At this time, the
        non-Maori people who lived with the Maori and served as intermediaries
        between the two cultures were called Pākehā-Maori, and they became the
        first bicultural people. Some Maori chiefs even encouraged them to marry
        the Maori. However, this balance did not last long. The population of
        the non-Maori continued to increase and eventually became larger than
        the Maori. Treaty of Waitangi, which promises to protect the Maori and
        their culture, is a treaty signed by the native Maori and the King of
        England on the northern island of Waitangi. However, Britain later
        established a government in New Zealand and did not protect the Maori
        culture promised by the treaty of Waitangi They hoped the Maori would
        assimilate into the non-Maori culture, and they ignored the Maori
        culture in New Zealand for a long time and did not protect it at all.
        For example, they tried to relocate the Maori to a city where the
        culture of the non-Maori was dominant and there was no regulation to
        protect the Maori culture. So New Zealand has long been an informal
        monoculture until the Maori Renaissance in 1970. The Maori Renaissance
        is a social change made by Maori people and their supporters through
        protests that non-Maori violated the treaty of Waitangi.
        Representatively, in 1975, Dame Whinai Cooper marched with 5,000 people
        from Northland, traveled to the North Island, and arrived at Wellington
        to protest the loss of their land. Eventually, the British government
        accepted their protest and investigated whether Waitangi violated the
        treaty. Through this Maori Renaissance, society has changed. The
        government began to talk about New Zealand, where biculturalism would be
        balanced, They explained the treaty of Waitangi in the founding
        documents of the country. The non-Maori people protected the Maori
        culture again, and New Zealand changed and emphasized Biculturalism
        again New Zealand has changed again to balance the two cultures.However,
        the non-Maori and Maori continue to discuss and confront. Some Maori
        people argue that it's not enough biculturalism yet, They argue that
        efforts to protect Maori culture are insufficient and that non-Maori
        people need to make efforts to promote Maori culture and rights However,
        the non-Maori disagree with this argument, they said There are various
        cultures in New Zealand, and it is argued that it is too much to
        emphasize only Maori culture over other cultures.

      <h3 class="content_title text-white my-5">The Treaty of Waitangi</h3>
      <p class="text-center my-4">
        The Treaty of Waitangi was signed on February 6, 1840, by England and
        native Maori. It is the most important document in New Zealand's
        history.  First of all, back in the late 1830s to look into the
        historical background of the Treaty. The number of Europeans moving to
        New Zealand has increased rapidly at that time. Around 1840, a Large
        group of Europeans more than 2000 settled in New Zealand, the newcomers
        between the Maori dispute went on without end. Accordingly, instead of
        mobilizing military power, the British government promoted the
        colonization of New Zealand through the signing of a treaty.  The
        British government appointed William Hobson as the Governor of New
        Zealand. And instructed him to transfer the rule of the Maori tribe
        leader to Queen Victoria and make to give the queen whole rights of the
        deal instead of guaranteeing the Maori land and resources.  46 of the
        tribal heads of the New Zealand Tribe Association signed the treaty of
        Waitangi on February 6, 1840. Since then, William Hobson has toured all
        over New Zealand and obtained signatures. As a result, more than 500
        chiefs across the country signed the treaty of Waitangi excluding 39
        chiefs of Waikato.  The Treaty of Waitangi is as follows.  The Treaty
        has three articles. In the English version,   Maori cede the sovereignty
        of New Zealand to Britain   Maori give the Crown an exclusive right to
        buy lands they wish to sell and, in return, are guaranteed full rights
        of ownership of their lands, forests, fisheries, and other possessions;
        and   Maori are given the rights and privileges of British subjects.  In
        general, the unilateral invasion and slaughter of ethnic groups with
        stronger military power have been repeated countless times in the
        history of colonization. The Treaty of Waitangi has the historic
        significance of the whole world because the two ethnic groups were
        united according to the document instead of the big stick.   On the
        other hand, The Treaty of Waitangi was written in the Maori version and
        the English version, and there was a difference in interpretation, which
        caused conflict.  Differences in interpretation are causing countless
        disputes over how to divide the power of Maori and white people and how
        far Maori ownership of land and resources will be recognised. For this
        reason, the Maori protested against Britain (Maori Renaissance), which
        led to the establishment of the "Waitangi Court" in 1975, and all
        disputes arising from differences in interpretation of the treaty were
        decided to be mediated through this court. Every February 6, 1974, it
        was designated as a national holiday called Waitangi Day. Through a
        peaceful colonial treaty that did not mobilize force, Maori culture and
        British culture in New Zealand now exist together. Therefore, when
        discussing the founding history of New Zealand, the treaty of Waitangi
        has an important significance that cannot be left out.
